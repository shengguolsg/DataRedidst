# DataRedidst
two-Step data redistribution from irregular to regular

These routines are used for testing Examples in our Paper "Efficient data redistribution algorithms from irregular to block cyclic data distribution" which has been submitted to IEEE TPDS.

Its usage is simple. There is a Makefile in the directory 'src'.
